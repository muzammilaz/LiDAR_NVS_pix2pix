# Synthesizing LiDAR from RGB Image using generated dense LiDAR data from LiDAR Novel View Synthesis  

In this project, we trained Image translation model [SPADE](https://github.com/NVlabs/SPADE/) to generate LiDAR intensities in camera perspective conditioned on the RGB image from the camera. We utilize KITTI and KITTI-360 datasets for training the models.

We utilize LiDAR4D, a recent approach to LiDAR Novel View Synthesis, to generate dense LiDAR point cloud and use the projected intensities to train Image-to-Image translation models.
